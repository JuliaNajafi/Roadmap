# SAIS S2S Technology Reading List

This list covers a range of topics that are relevant to our work. The purpose of this list is that of the roadmap — to provide useful guidance in a complex landscape. The list is evolving — feel free to contribute!

## Core

* [Artificial Intelligence and Games](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Games-Georgios-Yannakakis/dp/3319635182/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1530642605&sr=1-3&keywords=Artificial+Intelligence+and+Games) by Georgis Yannakakis and Julian Togelius (book). The real world is comlpex — video games provide simulations of that complexity. Policy makers seeking to harness AI should start with games. This book serves as an excellent introduction to the field. 

* [Skill Shift: Automation and the Future of the Workforce](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/future%20of%20organizations/skill%20shift%20automation%20and%20the%20future%20of%20the%20workforce/mgi-skill-shift-automation-and-future-of-the-workforce-may-2018.ashx) by the McKinsey Global Institute (report). Technology is changing how we work and the policy community is no exception. This report clearly lays out the skills we needs to foster to adapt to AI-augmented labor processes.
