# SAIS S2S Technology Reading List

This list covers a range of topics that are relevant to our work. The purpose of this list is that of the roadmap — to provide useful guidance in a complex landscape. The list is evolving — feel free to contribute!

## Core

* [Artificial Intelligence and Games](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Games-Georgios-Yannakakis/dp/3319635182/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1530642605&sr=1-3&keywords=Artificial+Intelligence+and+Games) by Georgis Yannakakis and Julian Togelius (book). The real world is comlpex — video games provide simulations of that complexity. Policy makers seeking to harness AI should start with games. This book serves as an excellent introduction to the field. 

* [Analysis for Public Decisions](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Public-Decisions-Edward-Quade/dp/0130521272) by Edward S. Quade (book). We believe theory functions as an indispensable conceptual tool for decision-making. AI needs to be integrated into policy theory to enable enlightened public decisions. Quade's book shows how this was done successfully with previous analytic techniques — an important benchmark for future efforts. 

* [The Recovery of Ethics](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_recovery_of_ethics.html?id=ZoUQAQAAIAAJ) by Paul Nitze (book). Making decisions on the scale of geopolitics requires rigorous ethical self-testing in a highly operational context. This short book by the co-founder of SAIS clearly sets out the role of ethics in geopolitics. An important guide to dealing responsibly with accelerating technological change. 

* [Agile IT Delivery: Imperatives for Government Success](https://www.accenture.com/t20170928T154122Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-61/Accenture-Agile-Report-2017-FINAL-New.pdf#zoom=50) by Accenture (report). We believe that practioners and educators of global policy need to learn from contemporary software developer workflows. Deeply collaborative teams and hybrid delivery processes are needed to solve new streams of geopolitical challenges. The Accenture report is a valuable primer on agile transformation in the public sector. 

* [Multi-Agent Systems](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/pubs/imas/distrib/pdf-index.html) by Michael Wooldridge (lecture slides). Multi-agent systems provide one of the best frameworks for integrating computer science and global policy research. Wooldridge's slides give a comprehensive overview of the field.
