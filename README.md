# START HERE

SAIS.Technology S2S is a student-to-student (S2S) education platform focusing on tech-policy and located at the [Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/). We provide policy students with the tools they need to apply their geopolitical understanding to a world shaped by rapid technological advancements. 

For the moment, our web presence is only on GitHub. We are launching in September 2018 and will have our main website up by then. 

### Why we exist

We believe that rapid technological advancements are leading to profound changes in the conduct of global policy. Founded near the end of World War II, our graduate school, the Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), is committed to supporting and understanding the dynamics of an open and stable world. Adapting this commitment to a world shaped by rapid technological advancements requires an educational environment capable of fast reconfiguration and scale. To make guiding contributions to this environment at SAIS, we founded SAIS.Technology S2S. **Below is a snapshot of how we think, including links to presentations for [potential advisors](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/ADVISER%20deck.pdf) and [SAIS alumni](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/ALUMNI%20deck.pdf) and a [guidebook] with details on how we work**. 

SAIS.Technology S2S is a launching student-to-student (S2S) education platform at Johns Hopkins SAIS providing tools for technology-adapted leadership to 600 graduate-level policy students. (This is an expansion of the SAIS Technology Career Club, which we founded in February 2018, reaching 100+ members or ~17% of the SAIS MA student body in one month.) We work to ensure that SAIS students can optimally transfer their geopolitical knowledge to a world shaped by the developement and deployment of information technologies and artificial intelligence. We operate on a model of distributed learning — we teach from student to student and transfer knowledge through [tools] that are [built collaboratively, deployed fast and improved continously](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). Our tools range from weekly newsletters to semester-long workshops. We are passionate about optimizing how we learn to thrive in an environment that is defined by low ressources, little time and a fast evolving subject. We see the work of Paul Nitze, the founder of SAIS, as a model for our work - bringing together different worlds (the public sector, technology, business, education, among others) to advance of openness and stability in times of change.
