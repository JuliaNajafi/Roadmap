SAIS.Technology S2S is a student-to-student (S2S) education platform focusing on tech-policy and located at the [Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/). It provides policy students with the tools they need to apply their geopolitical understanding to a world shaped by rapid technological advancements. 

For the moment, our web presence is only on GitHub. We are launching in September 2018 and will have our main website up by then. 

### Why we exist

We believe that rapid technological advancements are leading to profound changes in the conduct of global policy. Founded near the end of World War II, our graduate school, the Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), is committed to supporting and understanding the dynamics of an open and stable world. Adapting this commitment to a world shaped by rapid technological advancements requires an educational environment capable of fast reconfiguration and scale. To make guiding contributions to this environment at SAIS, we founded SAIS.Technology S2S. **Below is a snapshot of how we think, including links to presentations for [potential advisors](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/ADVISER%20deck.pdf) and [SAIS alumni](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/ALUMNI%20deck.pdf) and a [guidebook] with details on how we work**. 

SAIS.Technology S2S is a launching student-to-student education platform, developing 

closely integrated into the SAIS student community

Bloomberg Beta is an early-stage venture firm backed by Bloomberg L.P., investing out of a $75M fund focused broadly on the future of work. (We are now investing out of our second fund. The first was the same size, so we now have $150M in total under management.) While we focus on general areas of interest to Bloomberg, we choose our investments independently, without preference for companies who have or want a relationship with Bloomberg. We invest for financial return. We do see Bloomberg as a template for startups — founded on a powerful idea, bringing transparency to markets, achieving global scale, with a strong and open culture that embraces technology, led by its founders for decades. To serve our founders, we seek — like the rest of Bloomberg — to bring different worlds together (business, technology, culture, the public sector, among others).
