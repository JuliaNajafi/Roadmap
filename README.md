**SAIS S2S Technology** is a student-to-student (S2S) education platform focused on tech-policy and located at the [Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/). We provide policy students with the tools they need to apply their geopolitical understanding to a world shaped by rapid technological advancements. 

GitHub is our main web presence — we believe in collaboration, continuous improvements and strive to bring open-source thinking into the policy domain. Our official launch is in September 2018. **Below is a snapshot of what we think, including links to a presentation for [potential advisers](https://github.com/SAIS-S2S-Technology/Roadmap/blob/master/ADVISER_deck.pdf) and [SAIS alumni](https://github.com/SAIS-S2S-Technology/Roadmap/blob/master/ALUMNI_deck.pdf) and a [roadmap](https://github.com/SAIS-S2S-Technology/Roadmap/blob/master/Roadmap.md) with details on how we work**. 

### Why we exist

We believe that rapid technological advancements are leading to profound changes in the conduct of global policy. Founded near the end of World War II, our graduate school, the Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), is committed to supporting and understanding the dynamics of an open and stable world. Adapting this commitment to a world shaped by rapid technological advancements requires an educational environment capable of fast reconfiguration and scale. To make guiding contributions to this environment at SAIS, we founded SAIS S2S Technology.

We aim for our work to contribute towards greater collaboration between the public sector and the technology sector. We see the work of Paul Nitze, the founder of SAIS, as a model for our work — bringing together different worlds (the public sector, technology, business, education, among others) to advance openness and stability in times of significant change.

To learn more about our mission and our background, please refer to the [roadmap](https://github.com/SAIS-S2S-Technology/Roadmap/blob/master/Roadmap.md).

### What we do

We operate on a model of distributed learning — we teach from student to student and transfer knowledge through tools that are [built collaboratively, deployed fast and improved continuously](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). We are passionate about optimizing our learning to thrive in an environment defined by low resources, limited time and the fast evolving subject of artificial intelligence and emerging information technology paradigms. 

For details on our products and tools and the rationale behind them, please refer to the [product section](https://github.com/SAIS-S2S-Technology/Roadmap/blob/master/Roadmap.md#our-products--our-tools) of the roadmap.  

Here is a breakdown of our operations:

* Newsletter — on tech and policy
* Global Scope blog — documenting tech-policy events in DC
* Events and conferences — hosting leaders at SAIS
* Distributed career guide — interviewing alumni working in technology
* Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy (CAPS) workshop — AI strategy and applications in [python-sc2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2)
* Career assistance — tailored advice to students
* Research opportunities — creating opportunities through partnerships
