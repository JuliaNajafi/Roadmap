# START HERE

Thank you for taking a look at SAIS.Technology S2S, a launching student-to-student (S2S) learning platform on technology-adapted policy leadership. 

For the moment, we're only on GitHub but our main website is coming soon.

**This repository contains:**
* two versions of a short presentation outlining our activities for [potential advisers](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/ADVISER%20deck.pdf) and [SAIS alumni](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/ALUMNI%20deck.pdf)
* an longer [overview](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/Overview.md) of SAIS.Technology S2S
* a [readling list](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/Reading%20list.md) on technology and policy

The presentation lays out who we are, what problems we aim to solve, what solutions we propose and how we want to partner with you. 

The overview contains details on our mission, tools and progress.

The reading list gives you insights into what we're thinking about and how we're thinking about it.
