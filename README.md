# START HERE

Thank you for taking a look at SAIS.Technology S2S.

SAIS.Technology S2S is a launching student-to-student (S2S) learning platform on technology-adapted policy leadership and located at the [Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/). 

For the moment, we are only on GitHub. We are launching in September 2018 and will have our main website up by then. 

**This repository contains:**
* two versions of a short presentation outlining our activities for [potential advisers](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/ADVISER%20deck.pdf) and [SAIS alumni](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/ALUMNI%20deck.pdf)
* a selfcontained [overview](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/Overview.md) of SAIS.Technology S2S
* a [readling list](https://github.com/LeoQK/SAIS-Technology-S2S/blob/master/Reading%20list.md) on technology and policy

The presentation lays out who we are, what problems we aim to solve, what solutions we propose and what partnerships we seek. 

The overview contains details on our mission, tools and progress.

The reading list gives additional insights into what we are thinking about.

### Our mission

We look forward to exciting collaborations to advance education and solve hard problems at the conjecture of technology and global policy.
