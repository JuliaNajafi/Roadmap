# START HERE

Thank you for taking a look at SAIS.Technology S2S, a launching student-to-student (S2S) learning platform on technology-adapted policy leadership.

**This repository contains:**
* two tailored versions of a short presentation outlining our activities
* an additional about section
* a readling list on technology and policy

The presentation lays out who we are, what problems we aim to solve, what solutions we propose and how we want to partner with you. 

The About section contains further details on our mission, tools and progress.

The reading list gives you insights into what we're thinking about and how we're thinking about it.
