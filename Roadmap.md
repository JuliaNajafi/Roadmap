# SAIS.Technology S2S Roadmap

## Contents

## Our graduate school, Johns Hopkins SAIS

We are located at and funded by the Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). Our official status at SAIS is that of a student organization and we are funded under the corresponding terms [link to partnerships].

We appreciate the opportunity to act as part of the SAIS community. For over 75 years SAIS has educated students in international relations and international economics. Emphasizing theory as well as practice, SAIS has graduated a highly diverse group of over 20,000 alumni with careers spanning academia, entrepreneurship, non-governmental organizations and diplomacy. In its pursuit to educate global leaders, SAIS is guided by the vision of its founders, Paul H. Nitze and Christian A. Herter. Nitze and Herter sought new methods of preparing men and women to cope with the international responsibilities that would be thrust upon the United States following the end of World War II. 

As accelerating technological progress is leading to new responsibilities in a changed geopolitical environment, the founding vision of Nitze and Herter has inspired us to create SAIS.Technology S2S.

Through his work in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and his numerous writings, Paul Nitze gained deep experience with many of the challenges that shape today's discussions on global policy and technological progress. In his writings on foreign policy Nitze developed four themes that guide our thinking:

* Educate generalists who have "the ability, on the one hand, to tap the wisdom of the past and give it continuity into the present, and, on the other hand, to sense the possibilities of the future as they emerge from the developing present" []
* Deploy theory as a conceptual tool for decision-making and ensure that this tool can be adjusted continuously 
* Guarantee that an ethical framework guides and gives meaning to analysis without reducing complexity
* Advance a holistic strategy for the adaption of new technologies as they are being developed

So why is SAIS.Technology S2S a valuable addition to the SAIS community? The geopolitical knowledge and strategic skill set of SAIS students provide invaluable assets in resolving some of the core challenges of a changing world. The continuous application and transfer of these assets depends on understanding and adapting to meaningful trends early. These trends are often complex and - from the perspective of policymaking - embedded in a broader set of concerns. So adapting first requires a balance of understanding that places trends within the existing set of concerns.


Hence, adaption requires a balance of understanding so that new trends can be understood within the set of existing concerns. 

SAIS.Technology S2S provides that balance of understanding for 
emerging information technology paradigms and artificial intelligence, both of which are certain to lead to fundamental shifts across the globe. 


information technologies and artificial intelligence.



Bloomberg L.P. invested in Bloomberg Beta to open that window to startups, and set up a structure that is rare for a corporate-sponsored firm — a true fund that invests for financial return, not an “operating division.” Bloomberg knows that great founders want investors whose interests are fully aligned with their own.

So Bloomberg Beta is set up to choose its own investments, and back companies solely on their merits and financial potential, regardless of whether they have (or intend to have) a business relationship with Bloomberg. We do focus exclusively on areas that are of relevance to Bloomberg -- we wouldn’t invest in a videogame, or a consumer e-commerce site for example. One way to think of our focus: we look at the future of work. If you’re focused on making leisure or family life better, we’re probably not your people.

We believe we can take the Bloomberg ethos and apply it to how we work with founders: putting our customers (founders!) first, developing deep expertise in our domain (the future of work), and convening different spheres (from every walk of life) to bring new experiences to our customers.

Ultimately, Bloomberg L.P.’s founders have succeeded at doing what we hope to help other companies do — create something extraordinary.

The students who consitute our membership at SAIS are post-graduates from a diverse set of backgrounds in the public and private sectors pursuing degrees in economics, international policy areas and regional studies. The geopolitical knowledge of SAIS students and their strategic skill set provide invaluable assets in resolving some of the core challenges of a fast changing world. Our job is to ensure that these assets are optimally transfered into a world where change is increasingly correlated with the developement and deployment of highly advanced technical systems.

Paul Nitze and his vision. 

## What we believe about technology and global policy

In educating students at SAIS about tech, we are guided by a set of beliefs about developements that will take place at the conjecture of technology and global policy. These developements can be grouped into two groups strategic and tactical. 

### Conceptual

Concepts surrounding the implementation of AI will become implemented into policy debates, and will become integrated into the existing policy frameworks. Essentially, issues relating to AI safety and AI strategy will need to be made operational. 

* AI safety
* AI strategy
* AI alignment 
* renewd need for cooperation - what can we learn from the past in approaching a new technology?

### Tactical

* new workflows



Strategic level: new way to think about conflicts and their resolution. Renewd need for international cooperation. 

Tactical level: new tools for conducting the daily work of governance and diplomacy. In this regard the public sector is no different from other sectors. Cooperation between machines, based on quantitative data, delegated automation. 


We believe much individual work will be done in collaboration with software that makes its own choices. Broader trends affecting the future of work will also affect the conduct of global policy and diplomacy as well as see a deep integration into the strategic realm. 

## What we believe about education

Model

Priorities

Developement workflow as approach to problem-solving

Teaching as decisionmaking under uncertainty. / Create hybrid skill set. / Draw on software developement best practices to design our educational product. / Multidirectional. Learn through teaching. / Build first. / Low-cost environment - student to student working environment. Fail, improve, repeat. / Rapid conceptualization. / Combine high-level introductions with hands-on fast-paced coding. / This is to augment the assets of the MA program. / Strive for collaboration across schools. / Education is just a form of strategic decision making - this environment does not enable decision-making under certainty. Things are moving fast and we do not have much time to adapt...rather than spending much time on our own reading up on this, the first thing we do is release a product. Decision-making under uncertainty. Enable continuous problem-solving. / Education in this realm is more important than ever and our first priority is to provide an educational product to our students to get them started...

## Our tools

Newsletter, Blog, Distributed Career Guide, Conferences and Events, CAPS, Career Assistance, Research Opportunities = open source and in partnership with other parts of JHU

## What partnerships we seek

We seek advisory-based partnerships. We want to partner with leaders and leading companies who see value in engaging with our students, who value an open debate, who are driving progress, who see the values of greater collaboration between public and private stakeholders.
