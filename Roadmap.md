## Our graduate school, Johns Hopkins SAIS

The students who consitute our membership at SAIS are post-graduates from a diverse set of backgrounds in the public and private sectors pursuing degrees in economics, international policy areas and regional studies. The geopolitical knowledge of SAIS students and their strategic skill set provide invaluable assets in resolving some of the core challenges of a fast changing world. Our job is to ensure that these assets are optimally transfered into a world where change is increasingly correlated with the developement and deployment of highly advanced technical systems.

## How we work

We work as a team. 

## What we believe about technology and global policy

We believe much individual work will be done in collaboration with software that makes its own choices. Broader trends affecting the future of work will also affect the conduct of global policy and diplomacy as well as see a deep integration into the strategic realm.

Priorities

Developement workflow as approach to problem-solving

Teaching as decisionmaking under uncertainty. / Create hybrid skill set. / Draw on software developement best practices to design our educational product. / Multidirectional. Learn through teaching. / Build first. / Low-cost environment - student to student working environment. Fail, improve, repeat. / Rapid conceptualization. / Combine high-level introductions with hands-on fast-paced coding. / This is to augment the assets of the MA program. / Strive for collaboration across schools. / Education is just a form of strategic decision making - this environment does not enable decision-making under certainty. Things are moving fast and we do not have much time to adapt...rather than spending much time on our own reading up on this, the first thing we do is release a product. Decision-making under uncertainty. Enable continuous problem-solving. / Education in this realm is more important than ever and our first priority is to provide an educational product to our students to get them started...
