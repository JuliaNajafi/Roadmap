## Our graduate school, Johns Hopkins SAIS

We are located at and funded by the Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). Our official status at SAIS is that of a student organization and we are funded under the corresponding terms [link to partnerships].

We appreciate the opportunity to act as part of the SAIS community. For more than 75 years SAIS has been a pioneer in international relations and international economics education. Emphasizing theory as well as practice, SAIS has graduated a highly diverse group of over 20,000 alumni with careers spanning academia, entrepreneurship, non-governmental organizations and diplomacy. In its pursuit to educate global leaders, SAIS is guided by the vision of its founders, Paul H. Nitze and Christian A. Herter who sought new methods of preparing men and women to cope with the international responsibilities arising at end of World War II. 

As accelerating technological progress is leading to new responsibilities and a changed geopolitical landscape, the founding vision of Nitze and Herter has inspired us to create SAIS.Technology S2S.

Through his work in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), Paul Nitze gained deep experience with many of the challenges that have come to shape today's discussions on global policy and technological progress. In response, Nitze developed four themes that closely guide our thinking:

* Educate generalists who have "the ability, on the one hand, to tap the wisdom of the past and give it continuity into the present, and, on the other hand, to sense the possibilities of the future as they emerge from the developing present" []
* Deploy theory as a conceptual tool for decision-making and ensure that this tool can be adjusted continuously 
* Guarantee that an ethical framework guides and gives meaning to analysis without reducing complexity
* Advance a holistic strategy for the adaption of new technologies as they are being developed

So why is SAIS.Technology S2S a valuable addition to the SAIS community? The geopolitical knowledge and strategic skill set of SAIS students provide critical assets in resolving some of the core challenges of a changing world. The continuous application and transfer of these assets depends on understanding and adapting to meaningful trends early. These trends are often complex and - from the perspective of policymaking - embedded in a broader set of concerns. So adaption first requires a balance of understanding that places new trends within the existing set of concerns.

SAIS.Technology S2S is built to provide that balance of understanding. It engages one of the most persistent trends in recent years -- emergent information technology paradigms and AI technologies -- and provides a model of distributed, student-to-student (S2S) learning that prioritizes collaboration, rapid application of knowledge and continual optimization of learning. 

We believe we can take the SAIS ethos and apply it to technological change: educating generalists, continuously adapting theory to enlighten decision-making, asking hard ethical questions and providing a holistic framework for integrating technological developements into policymaking. 

Throghout their careers Nitze and Herter have succeded at doing what we hope to help students do - embrace change to advance the values of an open and stable world. 

## What we believe about technology and global policy

To know how we work, it helps to know how we think about the impact of technology on global policy. The list below captures our beliefs -- specificially those about AI technologies as they relate to strategy and the changing nature of policy work. 

### New Global Threat Streams
AI technologies bring about new security challenges. These challenges are both technical -- issues pertaining to AI safety such as AI alignment or adversarial examples -- and strategic -- issues pertaining to the diffusion of AI military technology or the developement of AI enabled kinetic systems in a broader sense. A range of additional risk factors exists. These include economic shifts following wide-spread adoption of AI technologies or the deployment of AI for scaled disinformation campaigns. 

This is a complex threat landscape. We believe that an open debate between a range of stakeholders is fundamental to navigating this landscape succesfully. Solution development should equally leverage the strengths of the policy and engeneering communities.

### Renewed Need for Cooperation
The adoption of AI technologies offers renewed need for international cooperation. To mitigate core risks, existing multilateral frameworks offer a platform that can guide the development and deployment of AI technologies. Importantly, cooperation should be purused against the obstacles that multilateral approaches face in the present environment. 

We believe in the approximate realization of a multilateral approach to AI technologies. Some aspects of existing frameworks may not be suitable for governance of AI and may need to be adjusted accordingly. But international cooperation -- to the extent that it is possible -- is invaluable in guiding how AI technologies are best integrated into the geopolitcal environment. 

### Operational Ethics and Policy Domain Expertise
An important debate has emerged 
Fairness, accountability and transparency (FAT) have become 
Navigating the geopolitical landscape means making hard choices and minimizing tradeoffs. 
AI technologies are complex and this complexity can lead to unwanted tradeoffs -- operators may not understand how an AI enabled system makes its inferrences, executives may not be able to justify decisions based on these inferrences and citizens may lack the ressources to determine who is accountable for the decisions' outcome. 

Hence, current efforts on explainable AI are crucial and need to continue on a broader scale. Explanation, documentation, domain expertise.  

Domain expertise. Realism. 

### Reconceptualization of Policy Theory
The policy community can draw on a range of well-tested conceputal tools to build and evaluate its decisions. Some of these tools -- such as game theory -- offer valuable points of contact with the engeneering behind AI technologies. Research should explore and consolidate this overlap. Other tools -- such as grand strategy or deterrence theory -- are unrelated to aspects of engineering but offer frameworks for determining the impact of AI on the geopolitical landscape. We believe it is vital for research efforts to closely integrate both of these tools. Policy theory should not only be capable of framing AI technologies through established concepts but also capable of adjusting these concepts -- granually or fundamentally -- to support decision-making. 

### Changing Workflows of Policymaking
AI technologies will change how humans work. We believe that the policy community is no exception. This will lead to new workflows for the top and ground layers of policy work. New workflows will likely involve basing decisions on a continuous stream of quantitative data and automating away tasks through software. Arguably, much of this work will be done in collaboration with autonomous software. 

We believe it is vital that the policy community is prepared to adapt to these new workflows. Recent discussions in the realm of military education present a welcome starting point. In addition, we believe in the importance of open-source frameworks. Where possible, the policy community at large should engage with the open-source platforms of engineering to develop novel solutions. 

## How we build and transfer knowledge

SAIS.Technology S2S is built around student-to-student (S2S) learning model and draws on a distributed set of tools. Our work is dedicated to continously finding better solutions to one problem: transfering a complex, technical subject to graduate students who have no background in the field and limited time to read up on the fundamentals. 

Rather than being a constraint, this problem works as the engine of SAIS.Technology S2S -- it enables and validates our educational model. Why? The environment we operate in -- defined by low resources, little time and a steep learning curve -- requires us to pursue the adaptive workflows of software developement. We believe that experience with these workflows facilitates adapting to technological advancements more broadly. Here's how we strive to engage adaptive developer workflows:

We do not start the semester with a finished, unified educational product such as a lecture. Instead, we provide students with a set of prototypes that will evolve from basic functionality to a tailored, useful product as the semester progresses and -- on a longer horizon -- as SAIS.Technology S2S grows over time. 

We priotize that students participating in our programming workshops build a minimum viable product fast -- outline a short memo on testing machine learning algorithms, modify a bot playing an online strategy game --,'ship' that product by presenting it in a professional context, improve based on feedback and iterate the process. 

There is no clear distinction between teaching and learning in this process -- and there shouldn't be as the ability to collaborate horizontally is our most valuable ressource. 

We see our 'products' as a set of tools. They should be used as needed and re-build along the way. There are three groups of tools --awareness, adaption and advancement. 

### Awareness

**Purpose:** reach a maxmimum number of SAIS students, introduce them to current tech-policy issues and provide opportunities for students to develop a voice on technology

**Newsletter**
The newsletter features news roundups, summaries of relevant papers and short guest-posts from students who want to share ideas that are longer than a tweet but shorter than a blog post. Published weekly and publicly accessible. 
**Global Scope blog**
The Global Scope blog documents DC's views on technology through briefings on the many tech-policy events happening in the local think-tank circuit. Currently there is no streamlined, centralized, archival source on these events. We aim to change that. 
**Events and conferences** 
Through  events and conferences hosted at SAIS students are engaged in conversations with leaders in the technology and policy communities.

### Adaption

**Purpose:** guide students through relevant career opportunities in the technology sector and consolidate core skills that students can leverage to transfer their geopolitical knowledge into a technology-driven world

**Distributed career guide**
The distributed career guide opens a window into careers in technology that draw on a SAIS skill set. The guide consists of career-focused interviews with alumni working in or with the technology sector that will be realised individually and as a compiled report. 
* **Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy (CAPS) workshop**
CAPS is a semester-long weekly workshop focused on exposure to programming and a high-level introduction to AI and AI strategy. Starting from a fast-paced intro to the Python language and object-oriented programming, students build both scripted and learning-based game bots using the python-sc2 library for the online strategy game StarCraft II. 

The goal of CAPS is to ground students strategic reasoning about AI in hands-on programming experience. Students will write and present a technical memo as the workshop's capstone. 

### Advancement

**Purpose:** provide students with assistance in finding technology-related work or research opportunities, giving them the best possible chance to advance the field

**Career assistance** 
We provide students with tailored career advice based on their background and interests, feature their profile on our website and, where possible, network on their behalf. 

**Research opportunities** 
We engage stakeholders in the policy and technology communities to leverage the research skills of 600 SAIS graduate students for applied, research-based solution developement.
