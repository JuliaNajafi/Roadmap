# SAIS.Technology S2S Roadmap

## Contents

## Our graduate school, Johns Hopkins SAIS

We are located at and funded by the Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). Our official status at SAIS is that of a student organization and we are funded under the corresponding terms [link to partnerships].

We appreciate the opportunity to act as part of the SAIS community. For over 75 years SAIS has been a pioneer in international relations and international economics education. Emphasizing theory as well as practice, SAIS has graduated a highly diverse group of over 20,000 alumni with careers spanning academia, entrepreneurship, non-governmental organizations and diplomacy. In its pursuit to educate global leaders, SAIS is guided by the vision of its founders, Paul H. Nitze and Christian A. Herter. Nitze and Herter sought new methods of preparing men and women to cope with the international responsibilities that would be thrust upon the United States following the end of World War II. As accelerating technological progress is leading to new responsibilities and a changed geopolitical landscape, the founding vision of Nitze and Herter has inspired us to create SAIS.Technology S2S.

Through his work in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and his numerous writings, Paul Nitze gained deep experience with many of the challenges that have come to shape today's discussions on global policy and technological progress. In response, Nitze developed four themes that closely guide our thinking:

* Educate generalists who have "the ability, on the one hand, to tap the wisdom of the past and give it continuity into the present, and, on the other hand, to sense the possibilities of the future as they emerge from the developing present" []
* Deploy theory as a conceptual tool for decision-making and ensure that this tool can be adjusted continuously 
* Guarantee that an ethical framework guides and gives meaning to analysis without reducing complexity
* Advance a holistic strategy for the adaption of new technologies as they are being developed

So why is SAIS.Technology S2S a valuable addition to the SAIS community? The geopolitical knowledge and strategic skill set of SAIS students provide critical assets in resolving some of the core challenges of a changing world. The continuous application and transfer of these assets depends on understanding and adapting to meaningful trends early. These trends are often complex and - from the perspective of policymaking - embedded in a broader set of concerns. So adapting first requires a balance of understanding that places new trends within an existing set of concerns.

SAIS.Technology S2S is built to provide that balance of understanding. It engages one of the most persistent trends in recent years - emergent information technology paradigms and artificial intelligence technologies. In this pursuit, SAIS.Technology S2S provides a model of distributed, student-to-student (S2S) learning that prioritizes collaboration, speed and continual optimization of how students learn and apply their knowledge. 

We believe we can take the SAIS ethos and apply it to technological change: educating generalists, continuously adapting theory to enlighten decision-making, asking hard ethical questions and providing a holistic framework for integrating technological developements into policymaking. 

Ultimately, Nitze and Herter have succeded at doing what we hope to help students do - embrace change to advance the values of an open and stable world. 

## What We Believe about Technology and Global Policy

To know how we work, it helps to know how we think about the impact of technology on global policy. The list below captures our beliefs -- both those about strategy on a broader scale and those about the changing nature of policy work. 

### New Global Threat Streams
AI technologies bring about new security challenges. These challenges are both technical -- issues pertaining to AI safety such as AI alignment or adversarial examples -- and strategic -- issues pertaining to the diffusion of AI military technology or the developement of AI enabled kinetic systems more broadly. Additional risk factors exist. Examples include economic shifts following wide-spread adoption of AI technologies or the deployment of AI for scaled disinformation campaigns. 

We believe that successfully navigating this evolving thread landscape requires an open debate between a range of stakeholders. Solution development should equally leverage the strengths of the policy and engeneering communities.

### Renewed Need for Cooperation
The adoption of AI technologies offers renewed need for international cooperation. To mitigate core risks, existing multilateral frameworks offer a platform that can guide development and deployment of AI technologies. Importantly, cooperation should be purused against the obstacles that multilateral approaches face in the present environment. 

We believe in the approximate realization of a multilateral approach to AI technologies. Some aspects of existing frameworks may not be suitable for governance of AI and may need to be adjusted accordingly. But international cooperation -- to the extent that it is possible -- is invaluable. 

### Transparency is Fundamental to Stability
AI technologies are complex and this complexity can lead to unwanted tradeoffs -- operators may not understand how an AI enabled system makes its inferrences, executives may not be able to justify decisions based on these inferrences and citizens may lack the ressources to determine who is accountable for the decisions' outcome. 
Hence, current efforts on explainable AI are crucial and need to continue at a broader scale. 

In addition, we believe in the importance of open-source frameworks for ensuring transparency through collaboration. Where possible, the policy community at large should engage with the open-source tools of engineering to advance its mission and develop new solutions. 

### Reconceptualization of Policy Theory
The policy community can draw on a range of well-tested conceputal tools to build and evaluate its decisions. Some of these tools -- such as game theory -- offer valuable points of contact with the engeneering behing AI technologies. Research should explore and consolidate this overlap. Other tools -- such as grand strategy or deterrence theory -- are unrelated to aspects of engineering but offer valuable frameworks for determining the impact of AI on the geopolitical landscape. 

We believe both types of tools should be closely integrated with each other so that decision-makers will continue to derive reliable value from theory as AI technologies are changing operations on the ground and the geopolitcal environment at large. 

### Technology Changes the Workflows of Policymaking
AI technologies will change how humans work. We believe that the policy community is no exception. This will lead to new workflows for the top and ground layers of policy work. New workflows will likely involve basing decisions on a continuous stream of quantitative data and automating away tasks through software. Arguably, much of this work will be done in collaboration with autonomous software. 

We believe it is vital that the policy community is prepared to adapt to these new workflows. Discussions in the realm of military education are an important starting point.
