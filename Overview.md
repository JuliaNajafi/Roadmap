## Why we exist

We believe that rapid technological advancements are leading to profound changes in the conduct of global policy. Founded near the end of World War II, our graduate school, the [Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/), is committed to supporting and understanding the dynamics of an open and stable world. Adapting this commitment to a world shaped by rapdid technological advancements requires an educational environment that is capable of fast reconfiguration and scale. Hence, we founded SAIS.Technology S2S.

Extending this commitment across domains created by recent advances in technology requires an educational environment equally capable of fast reconfiguration and scale. To make guiding contributions to this environment, we founded SAIS.Technology S2S. 

SAIS.Technology S2S is a student-to-student (S2S) learning platform on tech-policy located at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Washington, DC. 


The students who consitute our membership at SAIS are post-graduates from a diverse set of backgrounds in the public and private sectors pursuing degrees in economics, international policy areas and regional studies. The geopolitical knowledge of SAIS students and their strategic skill set provide invaluable assets in resolving some of the core challenges of a fast changing world. Our job is to ensure that these assets are optimally transfered into a world where change is increasingly correlated with the developement and deployment of highly advanced technical systems.

Our platform is set up around a model of distributed learning -- we provide students with a set of tools to raise their awareness 

Tools - continuous improvement. Patches. 

Challenges from AI, decision-making cycles, accountability, explainability. Integration of these systems into our decision-making, geopolitical order, stakeholders...

Distributed educational profile. What also needs to change is the way that students learn...

*We seek to create a hybrid learning model...no experts...teaching is decisionmaking under uncertainty. We move fast, provide best-guesses, improve and reiterate. 

Learn equally about technology and its workflows. 

Challenge - students pursuing non-technical degress fulltime need to learn and apply their knowledge in a short amount of time. 

To learn about technology, we should first learn from the worflows that are used to develop technology.
