## Why we exist

We believe rapid technological advancements are leading to profound changes in the conduct of global policy. Founded near the end of World War II, our graduate school, the [Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/), is committed to supporting and understanding the dynamics of an open and stable world. Extending this commitment across the conceptual and geopolitical domains created by recent advances in technology requires an adaptive educational environment equally capable of fast reconfiguration and scale. Hence, we founded SAIS.Technology S2S. 

SAIS.Technology S2S is a launching student-to-student (S2S) learning platform on tech-policy located at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Washington, DC. The students who consitute our membership at SAIS are post-graduates from a diverse set of backgrounds in the public and private sectors pursuing degrees in economics, international policy areas and regional studies.

Tools - continuous improvement. Patches. 

Challenges from AI, decision-making cycles, accountability, explainability. Integration of these systems into our decision-making, geopolitical order, stakeholders...

Distributed educational profile. What also needs to change is the way that students learn...

*We seek to create a hybrid learning model...no experts...teaching is decisionmaking under uncertainty. We move fast, provide best-guesses, improve and reiterate. 

Learn equally about technology and its workflows. 

Challenge - students pursuing non-technical degress fulltime need to learn and apply their knowledge in a short amount of time. 

To learn about technology, we should first learn from the worflows that are used to develop technology.
