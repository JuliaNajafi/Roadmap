# :blue_book: Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy (CAPS) 
A six session workshop that explores ways in which computational methods can advance the applications of policy and strategy research. The workshop focuses on the potential of video games – and intelligent agents programmed in Python to play these games – to study strategic behaviour in complex, simulated environments.

The workshop starts Friday, October 26. 

Six weekly sessions 4 - 5 pm @ BOB 756

### Course Overview

#### :blue_book: Session 1 Introduction to CAPS
Covers how games are studied within AI research and outlines the intersection of AI and IR in such as fields as AI Strategy and AI Policy. We also install the required software.

*Optional readings*

1. [DeepMind on StarCraft II](https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-and-blizzard-open-starcraft-ii-ai-research-environment/) (blog post)
2. [StarCraft II’s Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/starcraft) with live streams from international pro gamer tournaments (videos)
3. [Career guide on AI Policy and AI Strategy](https://80000hours.org/articles/ai-policy-guide/) by 80,000 Hours (article) 

#### :blue_book: Session 2 Python Primer
Covers programming in Python from the ground up. Introduces object-oriented and asynchronous programming.

*Optional readings*

1. [Eric Matthes Python Beginner’s Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc/releases/download/v1.0.0/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc.pdf) (learning resource) 
2. [Brian Heinold A Practical Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.brianheinold.net/python/A_Practical_Introduction_to_Python_Programming_Heinold.pdf) (book) 

#### :blue_book: Session 3 Building a Rule-Based StarCraft II Bot
Covers the python-sc2 library that enables building scripted bots for StarCraft II. We explore the StarCraft II gameplay and build our bot through a set of iterations to defeat the StarCraft II game AI on ‘hard’ difficulty.

*Optional readings*

1. [Comprehensive overview of StarCraft II on its wiki](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/StarCraft) (documentation) 
2. [Overview of bot APIs for StarCraft II on the SC2 AI wiki](http://wiki.sc2ai.net/Main_Page) (documentation) 
3. [The GitHub repo of python-sc2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2) (documentation) 

#### :blue_book: Session 4 Building a Learning-Based StarCraft II Bot
Introduces basic AI techniques. Covers the expansion of our bot so that it centres on a learning-based model, which we will train on StarCraft II replay data. We also explore the more advanced pysc2 library.

*Optional readings*

1. Georgios N. Yannakakis and Julian Toeglius [Artificial Intelligence and Games](http://gameaibook.org/book.pdf) chp. 2.5 on supervised learning and chp 2.6 on reinforcement learning (book) 
2. Oriol Vinyals et al. [StarCraft II: A New Challenge for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04782.pdf) (paper) 
3. [The GitHub repo of DeepMind’s pysc2 library](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) (documentation) 

#### :blue_book: Session 5 Game Data Mining and AI Strategy and Policy
Covers two topics, game data mining and the intersection of AI and IR on issues such as AI interpretability. We start by analysing the performance of our bot through a set of tailored data mining tools. We conclude by discussing the potential of real-time strategy games for IR research and how AI and IR can interact.

*Optional Readings*

#### :blue_book: Session 6 Building and Hosting a Website Through GitHub
Covers how to create and host a free personal website through GitHub. Afterwards we conclude with drinks and pizza.
