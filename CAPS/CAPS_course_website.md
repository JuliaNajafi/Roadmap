# Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy (CAPS) 
A six session workshop that explores ways in which computational methods can advance the applications of policy and strategy research. The workshop focuses on the potential of video games – and intelligent agents programmed to play these games – to study strategic behaviour in complex, simulated environments.

The workshop will start in the second or third week of October with details TBA.
